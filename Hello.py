    This simulation app offers a variety of simulations to help you explore different scenarios and their outcomes. 
    Each simulation is designed to give you insights into specific processes or behaviors.

    - **Simulation 1**: Number Guessing Simulation
      - **Description**: A fun game where you guess a random number between 1 and 100. The app gives you hints whether your guess is too high or too low.
      
    - **Simulation 2**: Dynamic ATM Simulation
      - **Description**: Simulates the behavior of an ATM system including transaction processing, account management, and failure handling. This simulation helps you understand how an ATM system operates and responds to various scenarios.
      
    - **Simulation 3**: Analyzing Biased Dice Rolls
      - **Description**: Analyzes the behavior of biased dice rolls to determine if the dice is fair or biased. It simulates multiple rolls and uses statistical methods to provide insights.
      
    - **Simulation 4**: Monte Carlo Dice Simulation
      - **Description**: Uses the Monte Carlo method to simulate and analyze dice rolls over a large number of iterations. It helps in understanding probability distributions and statistical variability.
